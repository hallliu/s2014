Lamport:
    Lamport's Strong Clock Condition provides a guarantee on event ordering
    that respects communications that take place outside the usual process
    communication channels. However, it may be sometimes desirable to have the
    process clocks agree with the "real" time (NIST standard, e.g.) to some
    extent in systems such as GPS. Does Lamport's algorithm make any such 
    guarantees, and if not, how could it be modified so that it does?
